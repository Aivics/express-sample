# express-sample
A sample project organization scheme of ExpressJS web project

I was inspired by the blow articles:</br>
1. <a href="http://blog.pixelingene.com/2012/06/a-simple-organization-scheme-for-expressjs-apps/">A Simple Organization Scheme for Handling Routes in ExpressJS Apps</a> </br> 
2. <a href="http://himanshu.gilani.info/blog/2012/09/26/bootstraping-a-node-dot-js-app-for-dev-slash-prod-environment/">Bootstraping a Node.js App for Dev/Prod Environment</a> </br>

Based on these great ideas, I hope to create a standardized express template for my dev team to follow.
